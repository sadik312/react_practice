# React Tutorial
Using no frameworks at first so I can better understand vanilla React

## Building a new React Project
- To start a new React project, you need to pick a React-powered framework
- `npx create-next-app`
- This will create a react app using the Next.js framework

type `npm run dev` to start nextjs server

## React Components
- React apps are build from isolated UI called components
- React component is a js func
- Can be small like a button or big like an entire page
